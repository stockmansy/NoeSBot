# NoeSBot
A Discord bot based on Discord.NET (https://github.com/RogueException/Discord.Net) .NET core version.

It's currently fully in development still. But you can find a list of commands here: k4m1.linkpc.net:8888 (yes weird url)

Feel free to use this bot.
I'd love to hear your opinion on it. You can find me on my discord server. (Link at the top)

WIP but it's already a feature rich bot. Important: You can enable and disable features of the bot via commands! You can also change the bot's prefix on the fly.

Features such as play music, create quick polls, punish/silence users, twitch/youtube stream notifications, keep a list of media posted, and much more...

You can find a full list of commands by typing help, or checking the site.

For it to fully function it needs the following permissions:

    Manage roles
    Manage messages
    Send messages
    Read message history
    Attach files
    Add reactions
    Connect
    Speak
